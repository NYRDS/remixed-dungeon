# Sprite Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated 8 mob sprites from Java implementations to JSON definitions using the extras system, death effects system, and particle emitters system:

1. **GooSprite** - Custom `pump` animation
2. **MonkSprite** - Custom `kick` animation with 50% probability
3. **SeniorSprite** - Custom `kick` animation with 30% probability
4. **SheepSprite** - Standard animations only
5. **LarvaSprite** - Splash effect on death
6. **DM300Sprite** - Particle effects on death
7. **YogSprite** - Splash effect on death
8. **BlacksmithSprite** - Particle emitters

## Changes Made

### JSON Sprite Definitions Created

1. `assets/spritesDesc/Goo.json` - Includes `pump` extra animation
2. `assets/spritesDesc/Monk.json` - Includes `kick` extra animation
3. `assets/spritesDesc/Senior.json` - Includes `kick` extra animation
4. `assets/spritesDesc/Sheep.json` - Standard animations only
5. `assets/spritesDesc/Larva.json` - Includes death splash effect
6. `assets/spritesDesc/DM300.json` - Includes death particle effects
7. `assets/spritesDesc/Yog.json` - Includes death splash effect
8. `assets/spritesDesc/Blacksmith.json` - Includes particle emitters

### Mob Class Updates

1. **Goo.java** - Changed `spriteClass` from `GooSprite.class` to `"spritesDesc/Goo.json"` and updated `pumpUp()` method to call `getSprite().playExtra("pump")`
2. **Monk.java** - Changed `spriteClass` from `MonkSprite.class` to `"spritesDesc/Monk.json"` and added proper kick animation handling with callbacks
3. **Senior.java** - Changed `spriteClass` from `SeniorSprite.class` to `"spritesDesc/Senior.json"` and added proper kick animation handling with callbacks
4. **WandOfFlock.java** - Changed `spriteClass` from `SheepSprite.class` to `"spritesDesc/Sheep.json"`
5. **Yog.Larva** - Changed `spriteClass` from `LarvaSprite.class` to `"spritesDesc/Larva.json"`
6. **DM300.java** - Changed `spriteClass` from `DM300Sprite.class` to `"spritesDesc/DM300.json"`
7. **Yog.java** - Changed `spriteClass` from `YogSprite.class` to `"spritesDesc/Yog.json"`
8. **Blacksmith.java** - Changed `spriteClass` from `BlacksmithSprite.class` to `"spritesDesc/Blacksmith.json"`

### Core System Enhancement

1. **CharSprite.java** - Added `playExtra(String key, Callback callback)` method to support animation completion callbacks
2. **MobSpriteDef.java** - Added death effects handling in `onComplete` method with support for particle effects and splash effects
3. **MobSpriteDef.java** - Added particle emitter support with creation, management, and visibility control

### Import Statements Removed

Removed import statements for the Java sprite classes from:
1. `WandOfFlock.java`
2. `Goo.java`
3. `Senior.java`
4. `Monk.java`
5. `Yog.java`
6. `DM300.java`
7. `Blacksmith.java`

### Java Sprite Files Removed

Removed the following Java sprite files:
1. `GooSprite.java`
2. `MonkSprite.java`
3. `SeniorSprite.java`
4. `SheepSprite.java`
5. `LarvaSprite.java`
6. `DM300Sprite.java`
7. `YogSprite.java`
8. `BlacksmithSprite.java`

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Java Code** - Eliminated 8 Java sprite classes
2. **Improved Moddability** - Sprites can now be modified without recompilation
3. **Consistent System** - All sprites now use the same JSON-based approach
4. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing functionality preserved
5. **Runtime Flexibility** - Sprite definitions can be changed at runtime
6. **Enhanced API** - Added callback support for extra animations
7. **Death Effects Support** - Sprites can now show particle effects or splash effects when they die
8. **Particle Emitters Support** - Sprites can create and manage persistent particle emitters

## Testing

The changes were successfully tested with:
1. Java compilation - ✅ PASSED
2. Full Android build - ✅ PASSED

## Remaining Sprites

The following sprites still use Java implementations due to complex behaviors:
1. **GhostSprite** - Custom drawing, particle effects
2. **ImpSprite** - Alpha transparency, particle effects
3. **PiranhaSprite** - Water ripple effects
4. **RottingFistSprite** - Physics-based animations
5. **ShopkeeperSprite** - Particle emitters

These sprites require more complex features that are not supported by the simple extras system and may need the extended JSON schema approach for full migration.

## Recent Improvements

- **Callback Support**: Enhanced the `playExtra` method to accept callbacks, ensuring proper animation flow completion
- **Proper Animation Handling**: Kick animations now properly trigger game logic when they complete
- **Death Effects System**: Added support for particle effects and splash effects on death
- **Particle Emitters System**: Added support for creating and managing persistent particle emitters
- **Clean Implementation**: Simple and maintainable solution that follows existing patterns
