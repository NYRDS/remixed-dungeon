It's a fork of the famous Pixel Dungeon game featuring English, Russian, and many more localizations. The game is available on multiple platforms including Android, desktop, and web browsers. The project uses a sophisticated modding system combining Lua scripting and JSON configuration to allow extensive customization without modifying core Java code.",

      "content": "The modding system uses two complementary approaches: Lua Scripting for dynamic behavior customization (mobs, items, spells, traps, etc.) and JSON Configuration for static property definition (mob stats, level layouts, sprite animations, etc.). These systems work together to provide maximum flexibility while maintaining compatibility with the base game. Lua scripts use the RPD library to interface with Java game objects and provide methods to customize behavior.",

Key modding locations include: scripts/ directory with subdirectories for actors, ai, buffs, items, mobs, npc, objects, spells, traps; and JSON configuration in levelsDesc/, mobsDesc/, spritesDesc/, levelObjects/, hero/, among others.",
