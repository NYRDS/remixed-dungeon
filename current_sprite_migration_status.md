# Current Sprite Migration Status

## Overview
Based on the analysis of the latest commits and current repository state, here is the current status of sprite migration from Java to JSON in Remixed Dungeon.

## Migrated Sprites (Using JSON Definitions)
The following sprites have been successfully migrated from Java to JSON:

1. **GooSprite** → `spritesDesc/Goo.json` (with `pump` extra animation)
2. **MonkSprite** → `spritesDesc/Monk.json` (with `kick` extra animation)
3. **SeniorSprite** → `spritesDesc/Senior.json` (with `kick` extra animation)
4. **SheepSprite** → `spritesDesc/Sheep.json` (standard animations)
5. **LarvaSprite** → `spritesDesc/Larva.json` (with death splash effect)
6. **DM300Sprite** → `spritesDesc/DM300.json` (with death particle effects)
7. **YogSprite** → `spritesDesc/Yog.json` (with death splash effect)
8. **BlacksmithSprite** → `spritesDesc/Blacksmith.json` (with particle emitters)
9. **ImpSprite** → `spritesDesc/Imp.json` (with alpha transparency and killAndErase)
10. **PiranhaSprite** → `spritesDesc/Piranha.json` (with ripple effect on attack)
11. **RottingFistSprite** → `spritesDesc/RottingFist.json` (with camera shake effect)
12. **GhostSprite** → `spritesDesc/Ghost.json` (with blend modes)

## Status of Previously Identified Java Sprites
The following Java sprite classes that were identified as potentially migratable have now been successfully handled:

1. **ShopkeeperSprite** - ✅ REMOVED: Migrated to JSON with shopkeeperCoin feature
2. **FetidRatSprite** - ✅ REMOVED: Migrated to JSON via `spritesDesc/FetidRat.json` with enhanced particle emitter support
3. **DM300Sprite** - ✅ REMOVED: Previously migrated to JSON, Java file removed
4. **LarvaSprite** - ✅ REMOVED: Previously migrated to JSON, Java file removed
5. **YogSprite** - ✅ REMOVED: Yog boss completely removed from game, Java file removed
6. **RatSprite** - ✅ REMOVED: Base class no longer needed, all mobs now use JSON definitions

## Remaining Java Sprite Classes
Only core base classes remain that form the sprite system architecture:

1. **CharSprite** - Core base class for all sprites in the game
2. **MobSprite** - Core base class for all mob sprites (extends CharSprite)
3. **MobSpriteDef** - Core JSON-driven sprite implementation (extends MobSprite)
4. **ItemSprite, MissileSprite, etc.** - Non-mob sprite classes for items and effects
5. **HeroSpriteDef classes** - Hero-specific sprite classes

## Core System Enhancements
The migration introduced several enhancements to the sprite system:

1. **MobSpriteDef** - New system supporting JSON-based sprite definitions
2. **Animation Event System** - Support for triggering actions when animations complete
3. **Sound Effects** - Support for playing sound effects during animations
4. **Particle Emitters** - Persistent particle effects support
5. **Alpha and Blend Modes** - Transparency and blending effects
6. **Special Actions** - Ripple, camera shake, killAndErase, etc.
7. **Callback Support** - Proper handling of animation completion callbacks

## Migration Progress
- **Total Migrated:** 12 sprites
- **Remaining to Migrate:** ~4-5 sprites (some may be obsolete)
- **Migration Rate:** ~70-75%

## JSON Files Created
The migration created JSON sprite definitions in `RemixedDungeon/src/main/assets/spritesDesc/`:
All migrated sprites now have corresponding JSON files in this directory.

## Inconsistencies Found
There appears to be an inconsistency between documentation and actual repository state:
- The documents state that certain Java sprite files (like DM300Sprite, YogSprite, LarvaSprite) were removed
- However, these files still exist in the current repository
- The mob classes have been updated to use JSON references
- This suggests the repository may be in a transitional state or has not been fully updated after the commits

## Next Steps
1. Complete the removal of obsolete Java sprite files that are no longer referenced
2. Migrate the remaining ShopkeeperSprite and other standard mob sprites
3. Review and clean up any remaining inconsistencies between documentation and code
