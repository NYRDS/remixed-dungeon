  <string name="WndStory_Sewers">The Dungeon lies right beneath the City, its upper levels actually constitute the City\'s sewer system. Being nominally a part of the City, these levels are not that dangerous. No one will call it a safe place, but at least you won\'t need to deal with much evil magic here.</string>
  <string name="WndStory_Prision">Many years ago an underground prison was built here for the most dangerous criminals. At the time it seemed like a very clever idea, because this place indeed was very hard to escape. But soon dark miasma started to permeate from below, driving prisoners and guards insane. In the end the prison was abandoned, though some convicts were left locked up here.</string>
  <string name="WndStory_Caves">The caves, which stretch down under the abandoned prison, are sparsely populated. They lie too deep to be exploited by the City and they are too poor in minerals to interest the dwarves. In the past there was a trade outpost somewhere here on the route between these two states, but it has perished since the decline of the Dwarven Metropolis. Only omnipresent gnolls and subterranean animals dwell here now.</string>
  <string name="WndStory_Metropolis">The Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of dwarven city-states. In its heyday the mechanized army of dwarves had successfully repelled the invasion of the old god and his demon army. But it is said, that the returning warriors had brought seeds of corruption with them, and that victory was the beginning of the end for the underground kingdom.</string>
  <string name="WndStory_Halls">In the past these levels were the outskirts of Metropolis. After the costly victory in the war with the old god dwarves were too weakened to clear them of remaining demons. Gradually demons have tightened their grip on this place and now it\'s called Demon Halls.\n\nVery few adventurers have ever descended this far...</string>
  <string name="WndStory_Spiders">Many, many years ago there was a rich mine, full of magical stone. But once mineral veins dried up the miners moved out, leaving behind wide network of tunnels. Eventually this place was populated by spiders. But even these dangerous creatures, lurking in the dark, wasn\'t enough to scare away the brave and insane ones longing for treasures that might be found in the mines. For the scale of danger is always proportional to the amount of rumours telling about magical artefacts. Once upon a time an evil witch wondered into the tunnels trying to escape from prosecutors. But superstitious people wouldn\'t dare to step into the darkness. So they decided to wait. But she never showed up. Maybe witch has found another way out, maybe she managed to slip by the guards... or she perished, surrounded by rustle of the creatures of the dark.</string>

  <string name="Codex_Story_25">She stopped, frozen, at the heavy oaken door, and eyed the light emerging from the door\'s borders. From some neglected corner of her mind, recognition.\n
"Sunlight.." she muttered to herself. How long had it been? In the eternal gloom of the Dungeon, she had long ago given up on tracking the days. The light illuminated disused memories. She remembered her training, long days of arduous practice with \'rang and blade, of log keeping, and map making. She remembered the mantras and disciplines intended to allow her to retain some semblance of sanity as she plumbed the unknown depths. What she didn\'t remember, couldn\'t remember, were people.\n
She remembered their voices, their commands, and their warnings, but not their faces, nor their touch.\n
Pain had trained her. Remember the dangers, always the dangers. Rabid animals, undead, insane brigands, and cunning ninjas had fallen before her. She had cut, burned, stabbed, and poisoned her way through abominations, demons, clockwork abominations, and insane necromancers. Even Gods had fallen before her.\n
She had tracked Yog through Heaven and Hell, before silencing his corrupting whispers forever. Even then, there was work to be done. Yog was a servant of one even more occult and powerful than himself.\n
So she delved further, deeper. The old wizard\'s journal, still radiating power, had shown her the path. With the magic in it\'s pages, she traveled to a wild new land, a tiny village ensconced in a mighty forest. There, she finally tracked the evil to its labyrinthine source, and vanquished all who stood before her.\n
Now, in the faint daylight, she examined herself in a pool of cavewater. Her body was warped almost beyond recognition by magic. Her skin, pale to he point of translucency, was caked with dirt, grime, and soot. Her necklace of rings could pay a kings ransom, and her holster of wands contained enough magical energy to lay waste to armies. She gripped her weapons, literally fine enough to cut down the very gods. Truly, she had become master of this dark realm, this wasteland of despair.\n
She had chased evil to the far corners of the multiverse, but now she was paralyzed with fear. What if they reject her? What if they don\'t? How could she interact with these people anymore? Hell, she had lost count of the times death had claimed her, only to be pulled from its icy grasp.\n
No, there was no place for her in the light, not anymore. She turned from the meager light, and descended into the dark, perhaps for the last time.\n
