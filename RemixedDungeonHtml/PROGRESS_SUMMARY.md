# Progress Summary - HTML Implementation of Remixed Dungeon

## Overview
We've been working on making the HTML version of Remixed Dungeon compilable by implementing the necessary platform abstraction layer. The HTML version uses LibGDX's HTML backend and GWT for compilation to JavaScript.

As of August 29, 2025, the build fails with 31 compilation errors. See COMPILATION_ERRORS.md for detailed error information.

## Recent Improvements

Recent commits have improved the build configuration:
- Include `build/generated/sources/annotationProcessor/java/main` in html sourceSets so generated classes (e.g., BundleHelper) are compiled
- Added compileJava dependency on `:processor:compileJava` to ensure annotation processing runs before HTML compilation
- Retained generateBuildConfig and codegen dependencies
- Created `market_none` folder with platform-specific implementations for HTML
- Added proper Iap, PlayGames, Ads, and AdsRewardVideo implementations
- Updated HTML Game class with missing instance variables (iap, playGames)

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Class Conflicts
- Updated `Texture` class to match desktop version implementation instead of extending LibGDX Texture
- Updated `PlatformLuajavaLib` to match desktop version implementation
- Removed manually created `BundleHelper` to let the annotation processor generate it

### 2. Build Configuration
- Verified build.gradle configuration for HTML module
- Ensured proper source sets and dependencies
- Successfully configured code generation steps (codegen and generateBuildConfig)
- Configured build to include generated sources in compilation
- Added market_none source set for HTML-specific platform implementations

### 3. Updated Platform-Specific Classes
We've updated several platform-specific classes in the HTML module to match the desktop version's API:

#### StringsManager
- Added missing methods: `getVar(int)`, `getVars(int)`, `getVar(String, Object...)`, `maybeId(String, int)`, `getVars(String)`, etc.
- Implemented proper string caching and resource handling

#### ModdingMode
- Added missing methods: `isResourceExistInMod`, `isAssetExist`, `getClassicTextRenderingMode`, `modException`, `getBitmapData`, `listResources`, etc.
- Implemented proper resource handling for HTML environment

#### Preferences
- Converted from class to enum with INSTANCE to match desktop version
- Added missing methods: `getDouble`, `put` methods for different data types

#### Sample
- Added missing `play` method with 4 parameters (assetName, leftVolume, rightVolume, rate)

#### SaveUtils
- Added missing methods: `slotUsed`, `deleteLevels`, `copySaveToSlot`, `deleteSaveFromSlot`, `modDataFile`, `depthFileForSave`, etc.
- Implemented proper save file handling for HTML environment

#### FileSystem
- Added missing methods: `getInternalStorageFileHandle`, `exists`, `existsInMod`, `getInputStream`, etc.
- Implemented proper file handling for HTML environment

#### MusicManager
- Added missing `volume` method

#### NoosaScript
- Added missing methods: `camera`, `lighting`, `drawQuad`, `drawQuadSet`, `uCamera`, `uModel`, etc.
- Implemented proper graphics handling for HTML environment

#### BitmapData
- Added missing methods: `getWidth`, `getHeight`, `isEmptyPixel`, `makeHalo`, `createBitmap`, etc.
- Implemented proper bitmap handling for HTML environment

#### EventCollector
- Added missing methods: `levelUp`, `badgeUnlocked`, `logEvent` variants, `logException` variants, etc.
- Implemented proper event collection handling for HTML environment

#### AdsUtils
- Added missing methods: `initRewardVideo`, `bannerIndex`, etc.
- Implemented proper ads handling for HTML environment

#### AndroidSAF
- Added missing methods: `setListener`, `isAutoSyncMaybeNeeded`, etc.
- Implemented proper file handling for HTML environment

#### SystemText
- Added missing constructors: `(float baseLine)`, `(String text, float size, boolean multiline)`, etc.
- Implemented proper text rendering for HTML environment

#### Game
- Added missing methods: `requestInternetPermission`, etc.
- Implemented proper game handling for HTML environment
- Added missing instance variables: `iap` and `playGames`

### 4. Added Market-None Flavor Implementation
- Created complete market_none implementation with proper stubs for:
  - Iap (In-app purchases)
  - IIapCallback (IAP callback interface)
  - PlayGames (Game services)
  - Ads (Advertisement services)
  - AdsRewardVideo (Reward video ads)

## Current Status
The HTML version fails to compile with 40 errors during the `compileJava` phase. The build process successfully completes the code generation steps but fails during Java compilation.

### Remaining Issues
1. Missing methods in game-specific classes
2. Missing methods in modding and file system classes
3. Some UI components may still have issues
4. Android-specific references that need to be removed or stubbed
5. Method signature incompatibilities between HTML and Desktop implementations
6. Missing abstract method implementations
7. BundleHelper class generation issue

## Next Steps
1. Continue implementing missing methods in platform abstraction classes
2. Create stub implementations for Android-specific classes that don't apply to HTML
3. Fix method signature incompatibilities
4. Implement missing abstract methods
5. Address BundleHelper generation issue
6. Test compilation and fix any remaining issues
7. Address any runtime issues that may arise

## Challenges
1. Some Android-specific functionality doesn't have direct equivalents in HTML environment
2. Graphics rendering differences between Android and HTML backends
3. File system limitations in browser environment
4. Audio implementation differences between platforms
5. Input event handling differences between platforms
6. Method signature mismatches between HTML and Desktop implementations

## Approach
We're taking an incremental approach:
1. Identify missing methods through compilation errors
2. Implement missing methods with HTML-appropriate implementations
3. Use stubs where functionality doesn't apply to HTML environment
4. Test compilation after each change
5. Continue until the project compiles successfully

### Recent Build Test Results (August 29, 2025)

### Successful Steps
- Code generation (codegen task)
- Build configuration generation (generateBuildConfig task)

### Failed Steps
- Java compilation (compileJava task) - 31 errors

### Error Categories
1. Android-specific references (8 errors)
2. Platform-specific method implementations (7 errors)
3. Generic type incompatibilities (4 errors)
4. Missing abstract method implementations (3 errors)
5. Graphics and rendering interface incompatibilities (3 errors)
6. Event handling and input processing (2 errors)
7. Bundle and serialization issues (2 errors)
8. Constructor and type incompatibilities (2 errors)
9. UI/Window implementation issues (1 error)

## Build Commands Tested
```
./gradlew -c settings.html.gradle :RemixedDungeonHtml:compileJava
./gradlew -c settings.html.gradle :RemixedDungeonHtml:compileGwt
./gradlew -c settings.html.gradle :RemixedDungeonHtml:gwtSuperDev
```

All commands fail with compilation errors during the `compileJava` phase.
