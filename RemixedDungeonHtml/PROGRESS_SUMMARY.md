# Progress Summary - HTML Implementation of Remixed Dungeon

## Overview
We've been working on making the HTML version of Remixed Dungeon compilable by implementing the necessary platform abstraction layer. The HTML version uses LibGDX's HTML backend and GWT for compilation to JavaScript.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Class Conflicts
- Updated `Texture` class to match desktop version implementation instead of extending LibGDX Texture
- Updated `PlatformLuajavaLib` to match desktop version implementation
- Removed manually created `BundleHelper` to let the annotation processor generate it

### 2. Updated Platform-Specific Classes
We've updated several platform-specific classes in the HTML module to match the desktop version's API:

#### StringsManager
- Added missing methods: `getVar(int)`, `getVars(int)`, `getVar(String, Object...)`, `maybeId(String, int)`, `getVars(String)`, etc.
- Implemented proper string caching and resource handling

#### ModdingMode
- Added missing methods: `isResourceExistInMod`, `isAssetExist`, `getClassicTextRenderingMode`, `modException`, `getBitmapData`, `listResources`, etc.
- Implemented proper resource handling for HTML environment

#### Preferences
- Converted from class to enum with INSTANCE to match desktop version
- Added missing methods: `getDouble`, `put` methods for different data types

#### Sample
- Added missing `play` method with 4 parameters (assetName, leftVolume, rightVolume, rate)

#### SaveUtils
- Added missing methods: `slotUsed`, `deleteLevels`, `copySaveToSlot`, `deleteSaveFromSlot`, `modDataFile`, `depthFileForSave`, etc.
- Implemented proper save file handling for HTML environment

#### FileSystem
- Added missing methods: `getInternalStorageFileHandle`, `exists`, `existsInMod`, `getInputStream`, etc.
- Implemented proper file handling for HTML environment

#### MusicManager
- Added missing `volume` method

#### NoosaScript
- Added missing methods: `camera`, `lighting`, `drawQuad`, `drawQuadSet`, `uCamera`, `uModel`, etc.
- Implemented proper graphics handling for HTML environment

#### BitmapData
- Added missing methods: `getWidth`, `getHeight`, `isEmptyPixel`, `makeHalo`, `createBitmap`, etc.
- Implemented proper bitmap handling for HTML environment

#### EventCollector
- Added missing methods: `levelUp`, `badgeUnlocked`, `logEvent` variants, `logException` variants, etc.
- Implemented proper event collection handling for HTML environment

#### AdsUtils
- Added missing methods: `initRewardVideo`, `bannerIndex`, etc.
- Implemented proper ads handling for HTML environment

#### AndroidSAF
- Added missing methods: `setListener`, `isAutoSyncMaybeNeeded`, etc.
- Implemented proper file handling for HTML environment

#### SystemText
- Added missing constructors: `(float baseLine)`, `(String text, float size, boolean multiline)`, etc.
- Implemented proper text rendering for HTML environment

#### Game
- Added missing methods: `requestInternetPermission`, etc.
- Implemented proper game handling for HTML environment

### 3. Build Configuration
- Verified build.gradle configuration for HTML module
- Ensured proper source sets and dependencies

## Current Status
The HTML version is still not compilable due to remaining issues:

### Remaining Issues
1. Missing methods in game-specific classes
2. Missing methods in modding and file system classes
3. Some UI components may still have issues

## Next Steps
1. Continue implementing missing methods in platform abstraction classes
2. Create stub implementations for Android-specific classes that don't apply to HTML
3. Test compilation and fix any remaining issues
4. Address any runtime issues that may arise

## Challenges
1. Some Android-specific functionality doesn't have direct equivalents in HTML environment
2. Graphics rendering differences between Android and HTML backends
3. File system limitations in browser environment
4. Audio implementation differences between platforms

## Approach
We're taking an incremental approach:
1. Identify missing methods through compilation errors
2. Implement missing methods with HTML-appropriate implementations
3. Use stubs where functionality doesn't apply to HTML environment
4. Test compilation after each change
5. Continue until the project compiles successfully
