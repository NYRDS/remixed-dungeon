# Remixed Dungeon HTML Build

This module contains the HTML build of Remixed Dungeon using LibGDX's GWT backend.

## Current Status

**JAVA COMPILATION SUCCESSFUL** - As of August 30, 2025, significant progress has been made:
- Java compilation now succeeds after removing duplicate class definitions
- GWT module files have been restored and are found by the compiler
- GWT compilation is in progress but has classpath issues
- The Chrome theme issue has been resolved

See COMPILATION_ERRORS.md for details on remaining issues.

## Recent Improvements

Latest work has improved the build configuration:
- Resolved the Chrome theme inheritance issue by creating a modified JAR file
- Updated build.gradle to use the modified JAR with Chrome theme inheritance removed
- Created minimal Chrome theme files to satisfy GWT compiler requirements
- Java compilation now succeeds after removing duplicate classes
- Cleaned up source path configuration in build.gradle
- Restored GWT module definition files

## What's Fixed

1. **Duplicate Class Definitions**: Removed 43 duplicate Java files from `src/main/java` that also existed in `src/html/java`
2. **Source Path Configuration**: Updated build.gradle to remove the conflicting source path
3. **Java Compilation**: Successfully compiles without duplicate class errors
4. **GWT Module Files**: Restored GdxDefinition.gwt.xml and created GdxDefinitionSuperdev.gwt.xml

## Current Challenges

1. **GWT Classpath Issues**: GWT compiler cannot find some source classes despite correct configuration
2. **Module Inheritance**: May need to adjust module inheritance for proper class resolution

## Building

**Current Status**: Java compilation succeeds, GWT compilation in progress.

To build the HTML version of the game, run:

```
./gradlew -c settings.html.gradle :RemixedDungeonHtml:compileJava
```

To attempt GWT compilation:

```
./gradlew -c settings.html.gradle :RemixedDungeonHtml:compileGwt
```

## Next Steps

1. Resolve GWT classpath issues
2. Test runtime with superdev mode
3. Implement any missing HTML platform abstractions
4. Verify all functionality works in browser environment
