# HTML Compilation Errors

This document tracks the compilation errors encountered when trying to build the HTML version of Remixed Dungeon.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Missing BundleHelper Class
```
error: package com.nyrds.generated does not exist
import com.nyrds.generated.BundleHelper;
```
The BundleHelper class is generated by the annotation processor but is not being found during compilation.

### 2. Missing Methods in Platform Classes
Many errors related to missing methods in platform abstraction classes:
- Missing methods in ModdingMode (modException, listResources, getClassicTextRenderingMode, setClassicTextRenderingMode, getBitmapData)
- Missing methods in Preferences (put methods for different types)
- Missing methods in Game (playGames variable, iap variable)
- Missing methods in Sample (enable method)
- Missing methods in MusicManager (enable method)
- Missing methods in FileSystem (various file operations)

### 3. Missing Level Methods
Many errors related to missing methods in the Level class:
- getWidth() and getHeight() methods
- getPos() method on Hero objects
- getLayer() method on LevelObject objects
- isIsometricMode() method on Dungeon class

### 4. Type Inference Issues
Many errors related to val keyword and type inference:
- "incompatible types: Map<Integer,LevelObject> cannot be converted to val"
- "incompatible types: LevelObject cannot be converted to val"
- "cannot find symbol" for various methods on val-typed variables

## Detailed Error Categories

### Bundle/Serialization Issues
- Missing BundleHelper class
- Missing save/load methods in SaveUtils

### Platform Abstraction Issues
- Missing methods in ModdingMode (modException, listResources, getClassicTextRenderingMode, setClassicTextRenderingMode, getBitmapData)
- Missing methods in Preferences (put methods for different types)
- Missing methods in Game (playGames variable, iap variable)
- Missing methods in Sample (enable method)
- Missing methods in MusicManager (enable method)
- Missing methods in FileSystem (various file operations)

### UI/Android-Specific Issues
- Missing Android-specific classes and methods (KeyEvent.KEYCODE_I, AndroidSAF methods)
- Missing PlayGames class
- Missing Ads-related methods
- Missing UI event handling methods

### Graphics/Rendering Issues
- Missing methods in Texture classes
- Missing Gl.flush() method
- Missing Keys.Key constants
- Missing Touchscreen.processEvent method

## Root Causes

1. The HTML platform implementation is missing many methods that exist in the Android/Desktop versions
2. The annotation processor is not generating the BundleHelper class
3. There are Android-specific references that don't exist in the HTML version
4. Some core game methods are not implemented in the HTML version
5. Missing UI event handling for the HTML platform

## Next Steps

1. Fix the BundleHelper generation issue
2. Implement missing methods in platform abstraction classes
3. Remove or stub Android-specific references
4. Add HTML-specific implementations for UI event handling
5. Implement missing graphics/texture methods
