# HTML Compilation Errors

This document tracks the compilation errors encountered when trying to build the HTML version of Remixed Dungeon.

## Current Status

As of August 29, 2025, the HTML build fails with 31 compilation errors. The build process successfully runs the code generation steps (codegen and generateBuildConfig) but fails during the Java compilation phase.

## Error Analysis by File

The errors are concentrated in specific files, with SaveUtils.java having the most issues:

1. SaveUtils.java - Multiple errors (missing methods, incorrect method signatures)
2. CustomLayerTilemap.java - Multiple errors (missing script methods)
3. Various other files - 1-4 errors each

## Critical Issues

### 1. Missing BundleHelper Class
```
error: package com.nyrds.generated does not exist
import com.nyrds.generated.BundleHelper;
```
The BundleHelper class is generated by the annotation processor but is not being found during compilation.

### 2. Missing Methods in Platform Classes
Many errors related to missing methods in platform abstraction classes:
- Missing methods in ModdingMode (modException, listResources, getClassicTextRenderingMode, setClassicTextRenderingMode, getBitmapData)
- Missing methods in Preferences (put methods for different types)
- Missing methods in Game (playGames variable, iap variable)
- Missing methods in Sample (enable method)
- Missing methods in MusicManager (enable method)
- Missing methods in FileSystem (various file operations)

### 3. SaveUtils Implementation Issues
The HTML implementation of SaveUtils has extensive issues:
- Missing Hero.getInstance() method - uses `Dungeon.hero` instead
- Incorrect Dungeon.saveLevel() method signature - requires parameters in HTML
- Missing Dungeon.getLevelsForSave() method
- Missing Bundle.toHJSON() method - should use serialize() or similar
- Missing GLog.error() method - should use GLog.error(String, Exception)
- Missing Bundle.fromJson() method - should use Bundle constructor
- Incorrect Bundle.getInt()/getString() method signatures - missing default value parameters
- Missing Dungeon.loadLevelsFromBundle() method
- Missing FileHandle.file() method - should use FileHandle.file() alternatives

### 4. Graphics/Rendering Issues
- Missing GL20 interface method signatures (glGetProgramiv, glGetShaderiv) - incompatible parameter types
- Missing BitmapData methods (eraseColor, getPixel, makeCircleMask)
- Missing MaskedTilemapScript methods (resetCamera, uModel, lighting, camera, drawQuadSet)

### 5. UI/Android-Specific Issues
- Missing Android-specific classes and methods (KeyEvent.KEYCODE_I, AndroidSAF methods)
- Missing PlayGames class
- Missing Ads-related methods
- Missing UI event handling methods
- Missing Keys.Key constants (BEGIN_OF_FRAME, END_OF_FRAME)
- Missing KeyEvent constants (ACTION_DOWN)
- Missing Touchscreen.processEvent method
- Missing AndroidSAF methods (pickDirectoryForModInstall, copyModToAppStorage, mBaseSrcPath)

## Detailed Error Categories

### Bundle/Serialization Issues
- Missing BundleHelper class
- Missing save/load methods in SaveUtils
- Incorrect Bundle method signatures

### Platform Abstraction Issues
- Missing methods in ModdingMode (modException, listResources, getClassicTextRenderingMode, setClassicTextRenderingMode, getBitmapData)
- Missing methods in Preferences (put methods for different types: String, boolean, int, double, float)
- Missing methods in Game (playGames variable, iap variable)
- Missing methods in Sample (enable method)
- Missing methods in MusicManager (enable method)
- Missing methods in FileSystem (various file operations)
- Missing methods in SystemText (updateFontScale)
- Missing methods in StringsManager (useLocale)

### UI/Android-Specific Issues
- Missing Android-specific classes and methods (KeyEvent.KEYCODE_I, AndroidSAF methods)
- Missing PlayGames class
- Missing Ads-related methods
- Missing UI event handling methods
- Missing Keys.Key constants (BEGIN_OF_FRAME, END_OF_FRAME)
- Missing KeyEvent constants (ACTION_DOWN)
- Missing Touchscreen.processEvent method
- Missing AndroidSAF methods (pickDirectoryForModInstall, copyModToAppStorage, mBaseSrcPath)

### Graphics/Rendering Issues
- Missing methods in Texture classes
- Missing Gl.flush() method
- Missing Keys.Key constants
- Missing Touchscreen.processEvent method
- Missing GL20 interface method signatures (glGetProgramiv, glGetShaderiv)
- Missing BitmapData methods (eraseColor, getPixel, makeCircleMask)
- Missing MaskedTilemapScript methods

### Event Handling Issues
- Missing event processing methods (Keys.processEvent, Touchscreen.processEvent)
- Missing abstract method implementations (WndInstallingMod.onFileSelectionCancelled)

### Ads and Monetization Issues
- Missing Ads methods (isRewardVideoReady, removeEasyModeBanner, displayEasyModeBanner)
- Missing AdsRewardVideo method signatures (show method with parameters)

### Analytics and Event Collection Issues
- Missing EventCollector methods (logCountedEvent)

## Root Causes

1. The HTML platform implementation is missing many methods that exist in the Android/Desktop versions
2. The annotation processor is not generating the BundleHelper class
3. There are Android-specific references that don't exist in the HTML version
4. Some core game methods are not implemented in the HTML version
5. Missing UI event handling for the HTML platform
6. Incompatible method signatures between HTML and Desktop implementations
7. Missing abstract method implementations in HTML-specific classes

## Platform Abstraction Class with Most Errors

Based on the error analysis, **SaveUtils** causes the most compilation errors with multiple errors related to:
- Missing or incorrect method implementations
- Incorrect method signatures
- Missing dependencies (Hero, Dungeon, Bundle, GLog classes)

The **CustomLayerTilemap** class also has significant errors due to missing methods in the **MaskedTilemapScript** HTML implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the BundleHelper generation issue
2. Implement missing methods in platform abstraction classes
3. Remove or stub Android-specific references
4. Add HTML-specific implementations for UI event handling
5. Implement missing graphics/texture methods
6. Fix method signature incompatibilities
7. Implement missing abstract methods

## Build Commands Tested

```
./gradlew -c settings.html.gradle :RemixedDungeonHtml:compileJava
./gradlew -c settings.html.gradle :RemixedDungeonHtml:compileGwt
./gradlew -c settings.html.gradle :RemixedDungeonHtml:gwtSuperDev
```

All commands fail with compilation errors during the `compileJava` phase.

## Required Dependencies

The build process requires:
- lxml Python package (successfully installed)
- GWT 2.8.2
- LibGDX dependencies for HTML backend

## Error Summary

The compilation errors can be grouped into these main categories:
1. Platform-specific method implementations (15+ errors)
2. Android-specific references (8+ errors)
3. Graphics and rendering interface incompatibilities (5+ errors)
4. Event handling and input processing (2+ errors)
5. Ads and monetization interfaces (1+ errors)
