This is an open source roguelike game with pixel style graphics

Once upon a time, there was a small town. The townsfolk lived happily, but they were so poor that they couldn’t even afford to go somewhere decent on holidays. But on the day when everybody abandoned all hope, a miracle occurred. The ground beneath the town shook violently and burst out a myriad of despicable monsters. From that point on, all the townsfolk who had survived lived happily ever after. Why? Because the dungeon has attracted all sorts of heroes and adventurers. They protected the innocents and ended up being excellent spenders, boosting the town’s economy.
And now the little town flourishes, as it stands on top of a dangerous dungeon filled with dead adventurers and their miserable souls.
